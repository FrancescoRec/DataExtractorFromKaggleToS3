# Hello! Recchetto er matto here
This is how this app works:
* Put your database from kaggle in the list datasets but don't put the part: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets ... Example --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/digidb is 'rtatman/digidb'
* Create a Kaggle Token and use your credentials
* Name the S3 bucket and a S3 directory
* Use AWS CLI for the credentials
* Every time it's been raised an error it will save a checkpoint (don't worry I got you)
* It will start from the checkpoint at uploading
* enjoyy
